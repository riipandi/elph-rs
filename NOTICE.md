## Third-party attributions

Elph is a Rust workspace for building AI agent applications. It was originally inspired by
[pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/badlogicgames),
licensed under the MIT License.

The original pi project is a TypeScript-based AI agent toolkit providing a unified
multi-provider LLM API, agent runtime with tool calling and state management,
terminal UI library with differential rendering, and an interactive coding agent CLI.

Elph re-implements these concepts in Rust with the following key differences:

- **Language**: Rust (edition 2024) instead of TypeScript
- **Async runtime**: Tokio instead of Node.js
- **Rendering**: `tuie` + `crossterm` instead of pi-tui
- **Serialization**: Serde + JSONL instead of JSON
- **Memory store**: Turso-backed vector embeddings for lifelong agent context
- **Codegraph**: `elph codegraph` — AST-graph analysis for structural code review
- **MCP**: Built-in Model Context Protocol client integration
- **Subagents**: Built-in sub-agent orchestration (spawn, steer, resume)
- **Agent Swarm**: Multi-agent swarm coordination via `elph-swarm` crate
- **Extension system (planned)**: WASM instead of npm packages

The architectural design — tool system, provider abstraction, streaming event model,
session tree structure, and overall API shape — is derived from the original pi project.

Portions of the agent workflow (exit summary, goals, subagent orchestration, tool transcript layout)
are inspired by [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex).

The `floppy` memory module in `elph-core` is a Rust port of the [memelord SDK](https://github.com/glommer/memelord/tree/main/packages/sdk).

The `owly` crate is a Rust port of [OpenWiki](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki) by LangChain.

The `elph codegraph` integrates [code-review-graph](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph)
