`watchexec`, `tarpaulin`, `cross`, and `rustup` targets for cross-compilation.

### Installation

Install using the [install](./install.sh) script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://elph.space/install.sh | bash

Or use `cargo install` (requires Rust 1.96+):

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd elph

# Install required toolchain

```

Or publish individually:

cargo publish -p elph-ai

cargo publish -p elph-tui
cargo publish -p eclaw
